    "annotation": "The Wasteland's harkening first line, <i>'April is the cruelest month'</i> remains one of the most iconic opening lines in all of literature. As with many Eliot references, it's meaning is manifold, and subject to intense debate. Nevertheless, the overall theme is clear: April is a time of growth and spring, away from the comforting solitude of Winter. Eliot writes in the shadow the First World War, where the snow glazing over London hid the ramparts made of city. As the snow begins to melt, the horrors of life reveal themselves again to the author, and The Wasteland begins."
